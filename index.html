                <h2>What is Bitcoin?</h2>
                <p> Bitcoin is a consensus network that enables a new
                    payment system and a completely digital money.
                    It is the first decentralized peer-to-peer payment
                    network that is powered by its users with no central
                    authority or middlemen. From a user perspective, 
                    Bitcoin is pretty much like cash for the Internet.
                    Bitcoin can also be seen as the most prominent triple
                    entry bookkeeping system in existence.
                </p>
                <h2>Who created Bitcoin?</h2>
                <p>
                    Bitcoin is the first implementation of a concept called 
                    "cryptocurrency", which was first described in 1998 by Wei 
                    Dai on the cypherpunks mailing list, suggesting the idea of
                    a new form of money that uses cryptography to control its
                    creation and transactions, rather than a central authority.
                    The first Bitcoin specification and proof of concept was 
                    published in 2009 in a cryptography mailing list by Satoshi 
                    Nakamoto. Satoshi left the project in late 2010 without revealing
                    about himself. The community has since grown exponentially with
                        many developers working on Bitcoin.

                        Satoshi's anonymity often raised unjustified 
                        concerns, many of which are linked to
                        misunderstanding of the open-source nature of
                        Bitcoin. The Bitcoin protocol and software are 
                        published openly and any developer around the
                        world can review the code or make their own
                            modified version of the Bitcoin software. 
                            Just like current developers, Satoshi's 
                            influence was limited to the changes he made
                            being adopted by others and therefore he did 
                            not control Bitcoin. As such, the identity of 
                            Bitcoin's inventor is probably as relevant
                            today as the identity of the person who 
                            invented paper.
                </p>
                <h2>Who controls the Bitcoin network?</h2>
                <p>Nobody owns the Bitcoin network much like no one owns the technology behind email. Bitcoin is controlled by all Bitcoin users around the world. While developers are improving the software, they can't force a change in the Bitcoin protocol because all users are free to choose what software and version they use. In order to stay compatible with each other, all users need to use software complying with the same rules. Bitcoin can only work correctly with a complete consensus among all users. Therefore, all users and developers have a strong incentive to protect this consensus.</p>
                <h2>How does Bitcoin work?</h2>
                <p>From a user perspective, Bitcoin is nothing more than a mobile app or computer program that provides a personal Bitcoin wallet and allows a user to send and receive bitcoins with them. This is how Bitcoin works for most users.

                    Behind the scenes, the Bitcoin network is sharing a public ledger called the "block chain". This ledger contains every transaction ever processed, allowing a user's computer to verify the validity of each transaction. The authenticity of each transaction is protected by digital signatures corresponding to the sending addresses, allowing all users to have full control over sending bitcoins from their own Bitcoin addresses. In addition, anyone can process transactions using the computing power of specialized hardware and earn a reward in bitcoins for this service. This is often called "mining".</p>
                <h2>What are the advantages of Bitcoin?</h2>
                <p>Payment freedom - It is possible to send and receive bitcoins anywhere in the world at any time. No bank holidays. No borders. No bureaucracy. Bitcoin allows its users to be in full control of their money.
                    Choose your own fees - There is no fee to receive bitcoins, and many wallets let you control how large a fee to pay when spending. Higher fees can encourage faster confirmation of your transactions. Fees are unrelated to the amount transferred, so it's possible to send 100,000 bitcoins for the same fee it costs to send 1 bitcoin. Additionally, merchant processors exist to assist merchants in processing transactions, converting bitcoins to fiat currency and depositing funds directly into merchants' bank accounts daily. As these services are based on Bitcoin, they can be offered for much lower fees than with PayPal or credit card networks.
                    Fewer risks for merchants - Bitcoin transactions are secure, irreversible, and do not contain customersâ€™ sensitive or personal information. This protects merchants from losses caused by fraud or fraudulent chargebacks, and there is no need for PCI compliance. Merchants can easily expand to new markets where either credit cards are not available or fraud rates are unacceptably high. The net results are lower fees, larger markets, and fewer administrative costs.
                    Security and control - Bitcoin users are in full control of their transactions; it is impossible for merchants to force unwanted or unnoticed charges as can happen with other payment methods. Bitcoin payments can be made without personal information tied to the transaction. This offers strong protection against identity theft. Bitcoin users can also protect their money with backup and encryption.
                    Transparent and neutral - All information concerning the Bitcoin money supply itself is readily available on the block chain for anybody to verify and use in real-time. No individual or organization can control or manipulate the Bitcoin protocol because it is cryptographically secure. This allows the core of Bitcoin to be trusted for being completely neutral, transparent and predictable.</p>
                <h2>Can I make money with Bitcoin?</h2>
                <p>ou should never expect to get rich with Bitcoin or any emerging technology. It is always important to be wary of anything that sounds too good to be true or disobeys basic economic rules.

                    Bitcoin is a growing space of innovation and there are business opportunities that also include risks. There is no guarantee that Bitcoin will continue to grow even though it has developed at a very fast rate so far. Investing time and resources on anything related to Bitcoin requires entrepreneurship. There are various ways to make money with Bitcoin such as mining, speculation or running new businesses. All of these methods are competitive and there is no guarantee of profit. It is up to each individual to make a proper evaluation of the costs and the risks involved in any such project.</p>
                <h2>Can Bitcoin scale to become a major payment network?</h2>
                <p>The Bitcoin network can already process a much higher number of transactions per second than it does today. It is, however, not entirely ready to scale to the level of major credit card networks. Work is underway to lift current limitations, and future requirements are well known. Since inception, every aspect of the Bitcoin network has been in a continuous process of maturation, optimization, and specialization, and it should be expected to remain that way for some years to come. As traffic grows, more Bitcoin users may use lightweight clients, and full network nodes may become a more specialized service.</p>
